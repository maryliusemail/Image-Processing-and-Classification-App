# üñºÔ∏è Image Processing and Classification App

This project implements a simple image processing application with object-oriented design principles (classes, inheritance, and exception handling). It processes RGB images, builds a customizable image editing system, and uses a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to predict image labels.

## ‚ú® Core Features

### RGBImage Class
Handles the basic structure and validation of RGB images:
- **Constructor** to initialize image data and dimensions
- **Getter/Setter methods** to retrieve or modify pixels
- **Deep copying** to safely duplicate images
- **Validation and exception handling** for input types and values

_Example: (Insert image showing raw RGB image structure)_

### ImageProcessingTemplate Class
Implements basic image processing operations:
- **Negate**: Invert colors to create a photo negative

---
- **Grayscale**: Convert images to grayscale by averaging RGB channels
- **Rotate 180¬∞**: Rotate an image upside down
- **Get Average Brightness**: Calculate mean pixel brightness
- **Adjust Brightness**: Increase or decrease overall brightness
- **Blur**: Smooth images by averaging pixel neighborhoods

### StandardImageProcessing Class
A basic monetization version of the template:
- Inherits from `ImageProcessingTemplate`
- Adds **cost tracking** for each processing operation
- **Coupon system** to redeem free edits

_Example: (Insert image showing cost tracking in action)_

---

### PremiumImageProcessing Class
A premium app version with extra features:
- Fixed upfront **membership cost**
- **Tile**: Repeat an image to fill larger dimensions
- **Sticker**: Overlay an image onto another at specified coordinates
- **Edge Highlight**: Perform edge detection using convolution with a kernel

_Example: (Insert image showing tiling, stickers, and edge highlighting)_

---

### ImageKNNClassifier Class
Implements a simple K-Nearest Neighbors classifier for images:
- **Fit**: Load labeled training images
- **Distance**: Compute Euclidean distance between images
- **Vote**: Determine most common label among nearest neighbors
- **Predict**: Classify new images based on training data

_Example: (Insert diagram showing KNN neighbor selection and prediction)_
