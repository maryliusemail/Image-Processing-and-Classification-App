# üñºÔ∏è RGB Image Processing and K-Nearest Neighbors Classification System

This project implements an extensible image processing framework using object-oriented programming (OOP), and a basic machine learning image classification system. It focuses on handling low-level image representations, applying transformation pipelines, managing images through inheritance, and using a distance-based supervised learning algorithm for classification.

## ‚ú® Core Modules and Functionalities

### RGBImage Class
Defines the fundamental RGB image object using nested lists:
- Initializes 3D matrices representing pixels in `(row, column, [R,G,B])` format.
- Enforces strict type and shape validation with runtime exception handling.
- Supports controlled access to image data through getters/setters.
- Implements deep copying to maintain image immutability across transformations.


---

### ImageProcessingTemplate Class
Provides a library of stateless, computationally efficient image transformations:

- **Negate**: Invert pixel intensities (`255 - intensity`) across all color channels.

_Example:_  
![ezgif com-animated-gif-maker (6)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f9b3532-4384-4976-bd6e-47c04c745429)



- **Grayscale**: Average RGB channels per pixel using floor division.

_Example:_  
![ezgif com-crop](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5cf32b05-fbe5-4b72-8504-5dd6a4ae32c4)


- **Rotate 180¬∞**: Flip the image along both horizontal and vertical axes.

_Example:_  
![ezgif com-animated-gif-maker (5)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/623618e6-1b3f-4093-b6a7-adef07021e63)



- **Adjust Brightness**: Add/subtract uniform intensity with clipping at `[0, 255]`.

_Example:_  
![ezgif com-resize](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e23acb5a-3278-45bd-9e39-8379ad4c433b)


- **Blur**: Smooth image using local neighborhood averaging.

_Example:_

### StandardImageProcessing Class
Extends `ImageProcessingTemplate` with minor usage tracking:
- Inherits all transformation operations.
- Tracks the number of processing operations performed.
- Provides a coupon system to allow free operations temporarily.


---

### PremiumImageProcessing Class
Extends the base functionality with additional advanced image manipulation operations:

- **Tile**: Repeats an image to fill larger dimensions using modular indexing.

_Example:_  
![ezgif com-animated-gif-maker (7)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e5ad8d7-cd87-453d-80e8-eaab2044a559)


- **Sticker**: Overlays a smaller image onto a background at a specified (x, y) coordinate.

_Example:_  
![ezgif com-animated-gif-maker (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1c271e4-f3b9-468d-b1cb-a9fb19c879a3)


- **Edge Highlight**: Applies a 3x3 Laplacian convolution filter to detect and highlight edges.

_Example:_  
![ezgif com-animated-gif-maker](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5003de94-ac7d-4caa-adf9-d3d1dc61be02)

### ImageKNNClassifier Class
Implements a simple instance-based supervised learning algorithm for image classification:
- **fit()**: Stores (image, label) training data pairs.
- **distance()**: Computes flattened pixel-wise Euclidean distance between two images.
- **vote()**: Determines the most common label among nearest neighbors.
- **predict()**: Predicts the label for new images based on `k` nearest training examples.

Uses purely manual distance calculation and list operations for classification logic.

_Example:_  
*(Insert diagram showing a test image and its k-nearest neighbors with majority voting)*
